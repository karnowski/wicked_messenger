## Good Error Messages For Developers

I want to be able to have as many validations in my model as I want.  I want those validations 
to have technical, precise, even pedantic error messages.  This is especially helpful when using 
an XML web service API.  These types of "computer-ish" error messages, however, are not good 
for end-users.

## Bad Error Messages for End-Users

Why are Rails validation errors not good for end-users?  Well, error messages need to be aware 
of the context they're in, use plain English, and suggest a way for the user to repair the 
situation.  Since the model is blissfully unaware of the view the user is looking at way, way up 
in the app stack, how can the model ever hope to fill all those requirements?  It really can't, 
and even if it did, you'd be leaking your view into your model.  This sucks.

## Example

Say you're building a Company object, but one of the fields is an "Administrator Email" that 
will actually create a component User object.  The error messages, if you leave the email 
address blank, would look something like this:

	3 errors prohibited this from being saved
	There were problems with the following fields:

	    * Invitee is invalid
	    * Email can't be blank
	    * Email is too short (minimum is 3 characters)

What does this mean to the user?  Only one of these messages is useful -- "Email can't be blank."  
But it has a problem too.  On the form, the field label is "Administrator Email", so the message 
should be "Administrator email can't be blank".  (This could be very important if you had multiple 
email fields.)

The "Invitee is invalid" is because the Company object has a validates_associated :invitee which 
is actually a User object.  Great for a developer, complete gibberish to an end-user.  Additionally,
of course the "Email is too short", it's freaking *blank*!  Why show that redundant message?

See the NOTES file for more ideas how we would want to convert error messages.
