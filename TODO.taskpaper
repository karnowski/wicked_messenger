Better  Rails error messages:
- allow whitelist/blacklist @done
- allow to create error codes instead of messages
- allow view to choose better messages for each error code based ont he context
- change to not always prepend the attribute name
- allow adding/removing of error messages very easily
- allow error messages on any object, esp non ActiveRecord ones
	- support Jay Fields' "validatable" plugin/gem
- per bigfleet: have a stand-alone gem as well as rails plugin, to handle stand-alone activerecord apps
- brainstorm a DSL @done
- create a README @done
- create a rails plugin directory structure @done
- create a temporary dir/file in lib (so it'll be reloaded)  @done
- write a framework that let's be me build a DSL in the future @done
	- should monkey-patch error_messages_for @done
	- if called without a block, call the old error_messages_for @done

- break the modules up so there is one for base functionality and one for Rails-extensions like error_messsages_for? @done
	- this might also let me remove the fake "alias_method_chain" in the tests? @done

- find a safer/better way to handle the safe_erb conflict without manually calling "untaint" on the output from the base error_messages_for?
- handle all the normal options for error_messages_for
	 - header_tag - Used for the header of the error div (default: h2)
	- id - The id of the error div (default: errorExplanation)
	- class - The class of the error div (default: errorExplanation) @done
	- object - The object (or array of objects) for which to display errors, if you need to escape the instance variable convention
	- object_name - The object name to use in the header, or any text that you prefer. If object_name is not set, the name of the first object will be used.
	- header_message - The message in the header of the error div. Pass nil or an empty string to avoid the header message altogether. (default: X errors prohibited this object from being saved)
	- message - The explanation message after the header message and before the error list. Pass nil or an empty string to avoid the explanation message altogether. (default: There were problems with the following fields:)
- override the default error_message_on method too?
- automatically expand the errors of any "validates_associated" invalid component objects
- support trumping
- support mapping one message to another
- support adding additional messages
- support passing an error object instead of just the (object, field, message) tuple as parameters to methods like suppress, trump, etc
